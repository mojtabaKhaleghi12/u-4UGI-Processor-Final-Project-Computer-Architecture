# u-4UGI 8-bit Custom Processor (VHDL)

This repository contains the complete design and implementation of the **u-4UGI 8-bit custom processor**, developed in **VHDL** as the **final project for the Computer Architecture course**.

---

## Key Features

- **8 General-Purpose Registers (R0â€“R7):** Each 8-bit wide  
- **8-bit ALU:** Supports a variety of arithmetic and logical operations  
- **16-bit Instruction Format:** Compact and efficient encoding  
- **512-byte Addressable Memory:** Separate regions for program and data memory  
- **Supported Instruction Set:**
  - **Arithmetic & Logic:** `ADD`, `SUB`, `ADDI`, `SUBI`, `ADC`, `CMP`, `XOR`, `AND`, `SHL`, `SHR`
  - **Memory Access:** `LD`, `ST`
  - **Control Flow:** `BR`, `BZ`, `BS`, `BNZ`

## Implemented Components

- Instruction format and opcode encoding  
- Instruction fetch and decode unit  
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)  
- Program Counter (PC) management logic  
- Separate memory read/write units for data and instruction memory  
- 8-register general-purpose register file  
- Control unit for instruction sequencing and execution  
- Example machine code program for testing processor functionality
